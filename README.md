# 2048 version 1.0

4x4 grid. (supports any arbitrary sized tables, but due to the lack of a so-called "menu" you cannot change it during the runtime yet)
Undo operation included (by pressing SPACE). (Achieved by Memento design pattern)
Sound effects.
Control: Arrows

Used libs:
  glew32
  freeglut
  stbi_load
  freetype

Plans for v2.0:
  Menu capable of changing the table size before the actual game starts.
  GameOver texts, ability to restart game.

Long-term:
  Substitute the pink bg =)
